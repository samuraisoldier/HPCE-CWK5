Simplistic question addressing fairly obvious strategy for speedup at low scales. Nothing particularly exciting.
Lack of discussion as to why the optimised implementation performed poorly at lower scales. I don't know if it's a TBB or OpenCL (or both) solution. If it uses OpenCL, for example, are you including initialisation (e.g. context creation) in your timing? If so, why?
Only metric used is execution time.
No indication of how metric was established.
References made to "resolution" in third paragraph do not make sense. Resolution of what?
0.2 s is far too long for a single if statement. This must just be measurement noise or lack of other optimisation.
Execute() does *not* include data input.
